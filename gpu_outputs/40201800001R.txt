The image shows three variations of the same word, "CLARION," each in a different color and font style. The top version is in teal with a modern, sans-serif font. The middle version is in black with a similar font. The bottom version is in gray with a slightly different font style. Each version has a small graphic element resembling a stylized letter "C" or a wing-like design above the "I" in "CLARION."
